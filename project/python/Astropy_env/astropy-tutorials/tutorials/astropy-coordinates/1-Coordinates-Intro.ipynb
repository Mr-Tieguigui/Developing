    "Astronomers use a wide variety of coordinate systems and formats to represent sky coordinates of celestial objects. For example, you may have seen terms like \"right ascension\" and \"declination\" or \"galactic latitude and longitude,\" and you may have seen angular coordinate components represented as \"0h39m15.9s,\" \"00:39:15.9,\" or 9.81625º. The subpackage `astropy.coordinates` provides tools for representing the coordinates of objects and transforming them between different systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore how the `astropy.coordinates` package can be used to work with astronomical coordinates. You may find it helpful to keep [the Astropy documentation for the coordinates package](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html) open alongside this tutorial for reference or additional reading. In the text below, you may also see some links that look like ([docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html)). These links will take you to parts of the documentation that are directly relevant to the cells from which they link. \n",

    "In Astropy, the most common way of representing and working with sky coordinates is to use the `SkyCoord` object ([docs](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/skycoord.html)). A `SkyCoord` can be created directly from angles or arrays of angles with associated units, as demonstrated below. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, let's assume that we want to create a `SkyCoord` object for the center of the open star cluster NGC 188 so that later we can query and retrieve stars that might be members of the cluster. Let's also assume, for now, that we already know the sky coordinates of the cluster to be (12.11, 85.26) degrees in the ICRS coordinate frame. The ICRS — sometimes referred to as \"equatorial\" or \"J2000\" coordinates ([more info about the ICRS](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602086)) — is currently the most common astronomical coordinate frame for stellar or extragalactic astronomy, and is the default coordinate frame for `SkyCoord`. Since we already know the ICRS position of NGC 188 (see above), we can create a `SkyCoord` object for the cluster by passing the data in to the `SkyCoord` initializer:"

    "In this tutorial, we have introduced `astropy.coordinates` as a way to store and represent astronomical sky coordinates. We used coordinate objects, via the `SkyCoord` class interface, to parse and change coordinate representations and units. We also demonstrated how to use a `SkyCoord` object with the `astroquery` package to query an astronomical database, the *Gaia* science archive. We then created a single `SkyCoord` object with the queried data that represents the sky coordinates of many objects. Finally, we introduced the concept of using `astropy.coordinates` to represent a 3D position of an object or set of objects."
