    "In the previous tutorial in this series, we showed how astronomical *positional* coordinates can be represented and transformed in Python using the `SkyCoord` object ([docs](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/skycoord.html)). Many sources, especially stars (thanks to the Gaia mission), have measured velocities or measured components of their velocity (e.g., just proper motion, or just radial velocity).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore how the `astropy.coordinates` package can be used to represent and transform astronomical coordinates that have associated velocity data. You may find it helpful to keep [the Astropy documentation for the coordinates package](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html) open alongside this tutorial for reference or additional reading. In the text below, you may also see some links that look like ([docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html)).

What does this mean exactly? *Gaia* actually measures the (time-dependent) position of a star every time it scans the part of the sky that contains the source, and this is how *Gaia* is able to measure proper motions of stars. However, if every star is moving and changing its sky positions, how do we ever talk about \"the sky position\" of a star as opposed to \"the sky trajectory of a star\"?! The key is that catalogs often only report the position of a source at some reference epoch. For a survey that only observes the sky once or a few times (e.g., SDSS or 2MASS), this reference epoch might be \"the time that the star was observed.\" But for a mission like *Gaia*, which scans the sky many times, they perform astrometric fits to the individual position measurements, which allow them to measure the parallax, proper motion, and the reference position at a reference time for each source. For *Gaia* data release 2, the reference time is J2015.5, and the sky positions (and other quantities) reported in the catalog for each source are at this epoch. \n",
