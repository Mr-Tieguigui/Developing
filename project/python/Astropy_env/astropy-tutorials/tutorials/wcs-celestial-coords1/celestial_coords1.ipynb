    "This tutorial series aims to show how the content of Chapter 1 of \"An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics\" by Carroll and Ostlie can be applied to real life astrophysics research situations, using tools in the Astropy ecosystem. We will introduce two different approaches to building a `astropy.wcs.WCS` object, which contains meta-data that (in this case) defines a mapping between image coordinates and sky coordinates. The `astropy.wcs` subpackage conforms to the standards of the FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) used extensively by the astronomy research community. We will created a 2D WCS for an image of the iconic the Helix nebula (a planetary nebula) and display an image of the nebula with sky coordinates (here, equatorial, ICRS RA and Dec.) labeled. Finally, we will over-plot a scale bar on the Helix nebula image using WCS to give the reader a sense of the angular size of the image."

    "\n",
    "*World coordinates* serve to locate a measurement in some multi-dimensional parameter space. A World Coordinate System (WCS) specifies the physical, or world, coordinates to be attached to each pixel or voxel of an N-dimensional image or array. An [elaborate set of standards and conventions](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html) have been developed for the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format ([Wells et al. 1981](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981A&AS...44..363W/abstract)). A typical WCS example is to specify the Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) on the sky associated with a given the pixel or spaxel location in a 2-dimensional celestial image ([Greisen & Calabretta 2002](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A&A...395.1061G/abstract); [Calabretta and Greisen 2002](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A&A...395.1077C/abstract)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`astropy.wcs` subpackage](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/) implements FITS standards and conventions for World Coordinate Systems. Using the `astropy.wcs.WCS` object and `matplotlib`, we can generate images of the sky that have axes labeled with coordinates such as right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec). This requires selecting the proper projections for `matplotlib` and providing an `astropy.visualization.WCSAxes` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to initialize a `WCS` object: with a Python dictionary (or dictionary-like object, like a FITS file header) or with Python lists. In this set of examples, we will initialize an `astropy.wcs.WCS` object with two dimensions, as would be needed to represent an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WCS standard defines a set of keywords that are used to represent the world coordinate system for a given set of data (e.g., image). Here is a list of the essential WCS keywords and their uses; In each case, the integer $n$ denotes the dimensional axis (starting with 1) to which the keyword is being applied. In our examples below, we will have two image dimensions (axes), so $n$ will either be 1 or 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CRVALn**: the coordinate value at a reference point (e.g., RA and DEC value in degrees)\n",
    "* **CRPIXn**: the pixel location of the reference point (e.g., CRPIX1=1, CRPIX2=1 describes the center of a corner pixel)\n",
    "* **CDELTn**: the coordinate increment at the reference point (e.g., the difference in 'RA' value from the reference pixel to its neighbor along the RA axis)\n",
    "* **CTYPEn**: an 8-character string describing the axis type (e.g., 'RA---TAN' and 'DEC---TAN' describe the typical tangent-plane sky projection that astronomers use)\n",
    "* **CUNITn**: a string describing the unit for each axis (if not specified, the default unit is degrees.)\n",
    "* **NAXISn**: an integer defining the number of pixels in each axis\n",
    "\n",
    "Some good references of the WCS standard can be found [here](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html)."

For example, WCS information is most often included automatically in FITS files produced by software used to take images with most instruments at astronomical observatories. In cases when the WCS information is provided for us in a FITS file, it is typically included in a FITS header, which, when read into Python, acts like a dictionary object.
